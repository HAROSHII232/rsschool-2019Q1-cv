### Objective

For the last few months I have been trying to devote almost all my free time to learning html, css and javascript. Having tried it exclusively for fun, I was very interested. I found my guiding star. It is very important for me to follow the path of self-development, and I understand that in such an intensively developing industry like IT, I can do it every day.  
The greatest pleasure when you go from "I donâ€™t understand what is happening here" to "hey, I think I understand how it works, try how I add it to my project." For the sake of this feeling, I am ready to absorb information like a sponge and make maximum efforts to achieve my main goal - to find work as a junior frontend developer, in which RS School helps me a lot.  

### Skills

Basic knowledge about:
- HTML 5  
- CSS 3  
- working with GIT
- Javascript
