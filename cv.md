### Objective

For the last few months I have been trying to devote almost all my free time to learning html, css and javascript. Having tried it exclusively for fun, I was very interested. I found my guiding star. It is very important for me to follow the path of self-development, and I understand that in such an intensively developing industry like IT, I can do it every day.  
The greatest pleasure when you go from "I don’t understand what is happening here" to "hey, I think I understand how it works, try add it to my project." For the sake of this feeling, I am ready to absorb information like a sponge and make maximum efforts to achieve my main goal - to find work as a junior frontend developer, in which RS School helps me a lot.  

### Skills

Basic knowledge about:
- HTML 5  
- CSS 3  
- working with GIT
- Javascript  

### Code example

```
<header class="main-header">
    <div class="container">
        <nav class="main-navigation">
            <a class="main-header-logo">
                <img src="img/nerds-logo.svg" width="160" height="65" alt="Логотип Нердс">
            </a>
            <ul class="site-navigation">
                <li><a href="studio.html">Студия</a></li>
                <li><a href="clients.html">Клиенты</a></li>
                <li class="site-navigation-current"><a href="catalog.html">Магазин</a></li>

            </ul>
            <ul class="cart">
                <li class="login-link"><a class="cart-link" href="#">Корзина</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
